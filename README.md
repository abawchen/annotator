# React-Labeler

React-Labeler is a image annotation/labeling component implemented with React and Redux, which is inspired by [LabelMe](https://github.com/CSAILVision/LabelMeAnnotationTool) and [wkentaro/labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme).

But instead of setup a website or running on local machine, `React-Labeler` is a more like a lightweight component for easy customization or integration with your own React app.

It currently supports:

- Polygon annotation
- Rectangle annotation

You can see a quick demo [here](https://abawchen.github.io/react-labeler/).
